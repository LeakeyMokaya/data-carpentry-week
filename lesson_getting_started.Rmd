## A motivating example...

This is an example R script. Don't try to take in all the details just yet.
Instead, let it wash over you and think about the broad view. The gestalt. The
forest and not the trees.

```{r motivatingExample2, eval = FALSE}
# Load necessary packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggmap)

# Import the data; be sure to make all strings NOT factors because we aren't
# doing any statistics here so they hurt us more than help
learners <- read.csv("roster.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Split each students' email into its 2 constituent pieces, the id and the
# domain, based on what comes before and after the '@' symbol
# Then, reattach both values back to the file we just imported and renames
# those columns "id" and "email_affiliation"
learners <- 
  learners %>%
  strsplit(x = .$Email, split = "@") %>%
  do.call(rbind, .) %>%
  as.data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  cbind(learners, .) %>%
  rename(id = V1, email_affiliation = V2)

# Use the ggmap package to "geocode" the email_affiliation that we just 
# figured out for each student, which means go to Google and get a latitude
# and a longitude associated with that email domain. For instance, if your
# email domain is "ucdavis.edu", the geocode() function will return the
# latitude and longitude of the University of California, Davis in the United
# States
learners <- 
  geocode(learners$email_affiliation) %>%
  cbind(learners, .)

# Create a plot of the locations of each student's email_affiliation on a globe 
# by mapping the longitude to the x position on the plot, and the latitude to
# the y position on the plot. Use the borders() function from ggplot2 to 
# generate a rough sketch of the land masses on Earth. Color all the points red
# and make them twice as large as default. Ensure that the figure has a 1:1
# ratio between units on the x-axis and units on the y-axis.
dc_origins <- ggplot(data = learners) + 
  borders("world", colour="gray50", fill="gray50")  +
  geom_point(aes(x = lon, y = lat), color="red", size=2) +
  coord_equal()

# Visualize the plot that we just made
dc_origins

# Save the plot we made as a .png file to our working directory while
# specifiying its height and width
ggsave(plot = dc_origins,
       filename = "dc_origins.png", 
       device = "png", 
       units = "cm",
       width = 15,
       height = 5)
```
