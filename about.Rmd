## About the Course Website

This website was built entirely using `R` and `RStudio`-- the same tools you are learning in this very course.

For this course, we embrace the spirit of [collaborative lesson development](https://github.com/swcarpentry/collaborative-lesson-development). We leverage the community's effort to develop effective approaches to teach this material, and draw lessons from the following open sources:
- [Data Carpentry: R for data analysis and visualization of Ecological Data](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/)
- [Data Carpentry for Biologists](http://www.datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/)


## About the Instructors

**Michael Koontz** 

I'm a 3rd year PhD candidate at University of California, Davis in the Graduate Group in Ecology. I study how complex forest structure affects natural disturbances in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California. I use satellite imagery, Google Earth Engine, small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS), and field measurements to map trees and track the spatial patterns of tree mortality as a result of wildfires and bark beetle activity.

I've been using `R` since 2012, and teaching it since 2014 to a wide variety of folks including grad students, post docs, professors, industry researchers, and government scientists. I became a certified DataCarpentry instructor in 2016.

My favorite part of teaching `R` is helping people make the leap between novice (no programming experience and not really sure how to start) and beginner (writing their own code and having a better sense of how to ask for help).  

**Ryan Peek**

Ryan runs the Davis R Users Group (D-RUG) and has spearheaded the organized effort at UC Davis to train fellow ecologists at all career stages to be comfortable with programming in `R`.

Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills,
and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less
time, and with less pain. The lessons below were designed for those interested
in working with ecology data in R.

This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming
experience. These lessons can be taught in a day (~ 6 hours). They start with
some basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through
how to import CSV files, the structure of data frames, how to deal with factors,
how to add/remove rows and columns, how to calculate summary statistics from a
data frame, and a brief introduction to plotting. The last lesson demonstrates
how to work with databases directly from R.
