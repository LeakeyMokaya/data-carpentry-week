> ## Learning objectives
>
> * Gain familiarity the RStudio IDE
> * Manage your workspace in an interactive R session
> * Take a look at a data frame
> * Extend R with a package
> * To be able to seek help via `?` and Google

> #### Challenge 1 -- Make a new directory and project for DIBSI Day 2
>
> - In your project directory, either using the Project tab of RStudio or your OS' file system, 
> create the following directories:
>     - data
>     - scripts
>     - results
> - Create a new .R script file in the scripts/ folder calling it whatever you like

> #### Challenge 2 -- Explore a data frame
>
> - In the script file you just created, write a line of code that will load the 
> `gapminder` package
> - Write another line of code using the `head()` function on the `gapminder` 
> data frame to view the first 6 rows (Remember that, in this case, there is
> both a data frame and a package that have the same name. This won't always
> be true. Sometimes packages don't have any data associated with them at all)

> #### Challenge 3 (advanced) -- Extend R with a new package
> - In the same .R script file, write a line of code that will install the 
> `dplyr` package.
> - Use the `glimpse()` function on the `gapminder` data frame view it in a
> different way than you saw using `head()`.
> - Did that code work? Why not? How can you fix it? (hint: my first step is
> often to copy the error and Google it!)
