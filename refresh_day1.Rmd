> ## Learning objectives
>
> * Gain familiarity the RStudio IDE
> * Manage your workspace in an interactive R session
> * Understand variable assignment
> * Use load() to import a data set
> * Take a look at a data frame
> * Add columns, subset, and summarize a data frame
> * To be able to seek help via `?` and Google

> #### Challenge 1 -- Make a new directory and project for DIBSI Day 2
>
> - In your project directory, either using the Project tab of RStudio or your OS' file system, 
> create the following directories:
>     - data
>     - scripts
>     - results
> - Create a new .R script file in the scripts/ folder calling it whatever you like

> #### MCQ -- Variable Assignment
>
> What does the following code print?
> ```
> a <- 1
> b <- 2
> c <- a + b
> b <- 4
> a <- b
> c <- a
> c 
> ```
>
> ```
> Option 1) a  
> Option 2) 3  
> Option 3) 4  
> Option 4) ::nothing::  
> ```
>

> #### Challenge 2 -- Extra practice: Assignment & Comparison
>
> Which elephant weighs more? Convert one's weight to the units of the other, 
and store the result in an appropriately-named new variable. Write a command to 
test whether elephant1 weights more than elephant2 (1 kg â‰ˆ 2.2 lb).
>
> ```{r, eval=FALSE}
> elephant1_kg <- 3492
> elephant2_lb <- 7757
> ```
>

> #### MCQ -- Subset and vectorize 
>
> Load the continents data frame again. Make a copy from your day 1 project
> folder, and move it to the data folder you just created for day 2.
>
> What is the total land area of continents that have at least 10% of the 
> world's population? 
>
> - Use subsetting to get the areas you want
> - Use the `sum()` function to find the total land area
>
> ```
> Option 1) 149428500
> Option 2) 126700000
> Option 3) 22728500
> Option 4) 100
> ```

## Data types in R

For a brief note on data types in R, we turn to the Data Carpentry: R for data 
analysis and visualization of Ecological Data [Introduction to R materials](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html#vectors_and_data_types).

This lesson is adapted from the Software Carpentry: R for Reproducible 
Scientific Analysis [Vectors and Data Frames materials](http://data-lessons.github.io/gapminder-R/03-data-types-subsetting.html)
and the Data Carpentry: R for data analysis and visualization of Ecological Data 
[Introduction to R materials](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html#vectors_and_data_types).
